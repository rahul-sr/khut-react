should be render, but its not neceesary
- the prop should be a function that
returns a React element or JSX - usage:
a rendering logic can be extracted
outside and passed as rendered prop for
reusge across multiple components
function User() { return (
<ProfileCard
  render="{renderCurrency}"
/>
<AccountStatement
  render="{renderCurrency}"
/>
) }
